          <h2 class="containet-one-title">Finding simplicity in life</h2>
          <p class="container-desc">Life can get complicated really quickly, but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways to simplify your life, a few of which we've explored in the past. This week we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can find simplicity in the life you already living. </p>
          <h2>How I turned things around</h2>
          <p>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job.</p>
          <p>It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.</p>
          <h2>Now I live the simple life</h2>
          <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
          <p>With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!</p>
